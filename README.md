# Waze Churn Prevention Project

## Scenario
Waze's navigation app revolutionizes global travel with community-driven improvements. The project goal was to analyze data and combat user churn, targeting monthly rates. This endeavor supports Waze's growth strategy, aiming to develop a churn prediction model for enhanced retention and strategic decision-making.

## Overview

### Goal
The objective was to construct a machine learning model capable of forecasting user churn.

### Tasks Accomplished
Employed Python for the exploration and analysis of Waze's user data, generating visualizations, and executing hypothesis tests. Developed binomial logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost models.

### Results
The XGBoost model exhibited superior performance compared to the random forest model, showcasing a stronger fit to the data. Additionally, the recall score (17%) nearly doubled that of the logistic regression model while preserving similar accuracy and precision scores.
